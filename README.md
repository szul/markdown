# Markdown
A JavaScript powered markdown engine (written in TypeScript) for converting markdown to HTML.

Originally adapted from [Mathieu 'p01' Henri](https://github.com/p01/mmd.js), this markdown engine was used inside of the [Metron](https://github.com/strangelooprun/metron) library, but is now being abstracted and modified for general purpose use.

## Installation

    npm install @strangelooprun/markdown --save

This will install the module as a Node.js dependency. You will need to use something like Require.JS or Browserify to include the package in your front-end JavaScript.
