# Metron Markdown
A JavaScript powered markdown engine (written in TypeScript) for converting markdown to HTML.

Originally adapted from [Mathieu 'p01' Henri](https://github.com/p01/mmd.js), this markdown engine was used inside of the [metron](https://github.com/metronical/metron) library, but is now being abstracted and modified for general purpose use.
